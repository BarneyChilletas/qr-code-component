# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). The goal was to build a simple, responsive QR code component using HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) font from Google Fonts

### What I learned

- How to center a component both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.
- How to use custom fonts and color variables for consistent design.
- How to create a responsive card layout with rounded corners and padding.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility, such as improving alt text and keyboard navigation. I also plan to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
